# Waste_Segregation 
Sortify: Intelligent Garbage Classifier Bot

Sortify is an AI-powered, autonomous waste management bot designed to revolutionize waste segregation and collection. Using advanced CNN models, IoT, and GPS tracking, Sortify automates sorting with 85-90% accuracy, minimizes human dependency, and adapts to diverse environments like schools, industries, and smart cities. Built with Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, YOLO Mini, and Flutter for real-time analytics and user interaction.
